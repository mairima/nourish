  <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>

  <p>
    We are pleased that you are interested in our organisation. Protecting your personal data is especially
    important to our management. You can use our websites without providing personal data. If you wish to use
    specific services offered through our websites, applications, or social media channels, it may become
    necessary for us to process certain personal information. Where no other legal basis applies, we will
    always ask for your consent (for example, through a cookie banner) before processing your data.
  </p>

  <p>
    We comply with all applicable data-protection laws when handling personal information such as your name,
    address, email address, or telephone number. This Privacy Notice explains which data we process and which
    rights you have as a data subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    We apply technical and organisational measures to protect your data as effectively as possible. However,
    internet-based data transmission may have security gaps, so complete protection cannot be guaranteed.
    You are free to provide your personal data to us by other means, such as by telephone.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Notice fulfils our obligations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
    the laws of EU/EEA Member States, and other international privacy laws such as the UK-GDPR,
    Swiss Data-Protection Act (DSG/DSV), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA),
    the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), and comparable global frameworks.
    It should be interpreted in accordance with the relevant national terminology and legal foundations.

    For easier reading, gender-specific forms (m/f/d/other) are not used; all terms apply equally to all
    genders.

    protection laws of the European Union and European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Switzerland
    (DSG/DSV), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL),

  <h2>3. Collection of General Data and Information</h2>

  <p>
    Each time our website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system, a series of general data and
    information is collected and stored in the server’s log files. This may include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Browser type and version used</li>
    <li>Operating system of the accessing device</li>
    <li>Referring website (the site from which the visitor arrived)</li>
    <li>Subpages accessed on our website</li>
    <li>Date and time of access</li>
    <li>Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
    <li>Internet service provider of the accessing system</li>
    <li>Other similar data and information used for security purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not draw conclusions about the individual user from this data. The information is required to:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Deliver website content correctly,</li>
    <li>Optimize website content and advertisements,</li>
    <li>Ensure long-term functionality of our IT systems, and</li>
    <li>Provide law enforcement authorities with necessary information in case of cyberattacks.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These anonymised data are analysed statistically to enhance data protection and IT security in our company,
    ensuring the best possible protection for personal data we process. Server log data are stored separately
    from any personal data provided by a data subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this processing is to ensure IT security and protection against threats. The legal basis is
    Article 6(1)(f) GDPR — our legitimate interest lies particularly in the protection of our information
    systems. Log files are deleted once the purpose for which they were collected has been achieved.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Contact Options via the Website and Your Consent</h2>

  <p>
    Our website provides information that enables quick electronic contact with our organisation and direct
    communication, including a general email address and, if applicable, a phone number. If you contact us by
    email, through a contact form, or via any other channel, the personal data you voluntarily transmit are
    automatically stored and processed for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or following up with you.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the transmission, storage, and processing of your contact details and inquiries, and for contacting
    you, we obtain your consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and 49(1)(a) GDPR as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    By submitting your personal data, you voluntarily consent to the processing of the information you
    provide for the purpose of handling your request and contacting you. By submitting your data, you also
    give explicit consent under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR for the transfer of your data to third countries and to
    the companies and purposes mentioned in this Privacy Notice — including those where no EU or EEA
    adequacy decision exists or where sufficient data-protection guarantees may not be available
    (e.g. under §702 FISA, Executive Order EO12333, or the Cloud Act in the United States).
  </p>

  <p>
    You were informed that data transfers to such third countries might not provide an adequate level of
    protection and that your data-subject rights may not always be enforceable. You may withdraw your
    consent at any time with effect for the future. The withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any
    processing carried out before the withdrawal.
  </p>

  <p>
    By submitting your data, you give several consents simultaneously — under EU/EEA GDPR, CCPA/CPRA,
    ePrivacy, and other international legal frameworks — which may serve as legal grounds for further
    processing of your personal data. By this act, you also confirm that you have read and understood this
    Privacy Notice.
  </p>
</div>

 


  <h2>5. Routine Deletion and Restriction of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>
    We process and store personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing,
    or as required by law or other applicable regulations. When the purpose of processing no longer applies,
    or when a legal retention period expires, the personal data are routinely restricted or deleted in
    accordance with statutory requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Rights of the Data Subject (under the GDPR)</h2>

  <h3>a) Right to Confirmation</h3>
  <p>
    Every data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal
    data concerning them are being processed. You may contact us at any time to exercise this right.
  </p>

  <h3>b) Right of Access</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to obtain, at any time and free of charge, information about your stored personal data
    and a copy of this information. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The purposes of processing</li>
    <li>The categories of data processed</li>
    <li>The recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data have been or will be disclosed</li>
    <li>The envisaged storage period or the criteria used to determine it</li>
    <li>The existence of rights to rectification, erasure, restriction, or objection</li>
    <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
    <li>The source of the data (if not collected directly from the data subject)</li>
    <li>The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic and consequences involved</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If personal data are transferred to a third country or an international organisation, you also have the
    right to be informed of appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
  </p>

  <h3>c) Right to Rectification</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to request the immediate correction of inaccurate personal data and the completion of
    incomplete data.
  </p>

  <h3>d) Right to Erasure (“Right to Be Forgotten”)</h3>
  <p>
    You may request the deletion of your personal data if one of the following applies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The data are no longer necessary for their original purpose</li>
    <li>You withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis for processing</li>
    <li>You object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds</li>
    <li>The data have been unlawfully processed</li>
    <li>Deletion is required by law</li>
    <li>The data were collected in relation to information society services for children</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Where we have made personal data public and are obliged to delete it, we will take reasonable steps,
    including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the data that you request deletion
    of all links, copies, or replications of that data, as far as processing is no longer necessary.
  </p>

  <h3>e) Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
  <p>
    You may request restriction of processing where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You contest the accuracy of your data (for a period allowing verification)</li>
    <li>Processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure</li>
    <li>We no longer need the data, but you require it for legal claims</li>
    <li>You have objected to processing and the balance of interests is being assessed</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>f) Right to Data Portability</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
    format, and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance, where processing is based on
    consent or contract and carried out by automated means.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also have the right to have the data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where
    technically feasible, provided this does not adversely affect the rights of others.
  </p>

  <h3>g) Right to Object</h3>
  <p>
    You may object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your
    personal data based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR. We will no longer process the data unless compelling
    legitimate grounds override your interests, or the processing is for legal claims.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your data are processed for direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time; we will then
    cease such processing immediately.
  </p>

  <h3>h) Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including
    profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you, unless it is necessary
    for contract performance, authorised by law, or based on your explicit consent. In such cases, we ensure
    safeguards to protect your rights and freedoms, including human intervention, expressing your point of
    view, and contesting the decision.
  </p>

  <h3>i) Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time with future effect. The
    withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.
  </p>

  <h2>7. General Purpose of Processing, Categories of Data and Recipients</h2>
  <p>
    The general purpose of processing personal data is to handle all operations related to customers,
    interested parties, business partners, and other contractual or pre-contractual relationships, as well as
    legal obligations of the controller. This applies unless a more specific purpose is defined for a given
    processing activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Categories of data processed include customer data, prospective customer data, employee data (including
    applicants), and supplier data. Recipients may include public authorities, external entities, internal
    departments, group companies, and other authorised parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    A list of processors and data recipients in third countries or international organisations is available
    on our website or upon written request.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Article 6(1)(a) GDPR applies where processing is based on consent for a specific purpose.  
    Article 6(1)(b) GDPR applies where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or
    pre-contractual measures (e.g. inquiries about our services).  
    Article 6(1)(c) GDPR applies where processing is required to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. tax).  
    Article 6(1)(d) GDPR applies in cases of vital interests (e.g. emergencies requiring medical disclosure).  
    Article 6(1)(e) GDPR applies where processing is necessary for public interest tasks or the exercise of
    official authority.  
    Finally, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR applies where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of our
    company or a third party, provided such interests are not overridden by the rights of the data subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    The GDPR specifically recognises legitimate interest as a lawful basis — for example, when the data
    subject is a customer of the controller (Recital 47, sentence 2).
  </p>

</div>

 

 <h2>9. Legitimate Interests and Direct Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    Where processing is based on Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR and no more specific legitimate interest is defined,
    our legitimate interest is the operation of our business for the benefit of our staff and shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may send you direct marketing about our own goods or services that are similar to those you have
    requested, ordered, or purchased. You may object to such marketing at any time (for example, by email)
    at no cost other than the basic transmission charge. The processing for direct-marketing purposes is
    based on Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR; our legitimate interest is direct marketing itself.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Retention Period</h2>
  <p>
    The storage period for personal data depends on the applicable statutory retention period. Where none
    exists, contractual or internal retention rules apply. After expiry, the data are routinely deleted unless
    needed to perform or initiate a contract or if other specific criteria are defined.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Legal or Contractual Requirements to Provide Data</h2>
  <p>
    The provision of personal data may be legally required (for example, tax laws) or contractually
    necessary (for example, identification of a contracting party). In some cases, providing data is required
    to conclude a contract. Failure to provide personal data may result in our inability to enter into or
    perform a contract. We will inform you case-by-case whether data provision is mandatory or voluntary and
    what the consequences of non-provision are.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
  <p>
    As a responsible organisation, we generally do not engage in automated decision-making or profiling.
    Should we do so in exceptional cases, you will be informed separately or in an additional section of this
    Privacy Notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Automated decisions, including profiling, may occur if (1) required to conclude or perform a contract,
    (2) authorised by law providing safeguards for your rights and freedoms, or (3) based on your explicit
    consent. In such cases, we implement appropriate measures to protect your interests, including the right
    to human intervention, to express your viewpoint, and to contest the decision.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Data Recipients in Third Countries and Safeguards</h2>
  <p>
    According to Article 46 (1) GDPR, personal data may be transferred to a third country only where
    appropriate safeguards exist and enforceable rights and effective remedies are available. These safeguards
    are usually ensured by EU Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before any transfer to a third-country recipient, we conclude Standard Contractual Clauses or rely on an
    adequacy decision (for example, EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension, Swiss-U.S. Framework).
    This guarantees adequate protection and enforceable rights. Copies of these safeguards or references to
    where they are published can be obtained from us or from official EU publications.
  </p>

  <h2>14. Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</h2>
  <p>
    Under Article 77 GDPR, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,
    in particular in the Member State of their residence, workplace, or the place of the alleged infringement,
    if they believe that the processing of their personal data violates the GDPR. Only one supervisory
    authority should be contacted to avoid duplicate complaints on the same matter.
  </p>

  <h2>15. Facebook Custom Audience</h2>
  <p>
    We use Facebook Custom Audience to display targeted advertisements on Facebook and Instagram based on
    user information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or on-site interactions (e.g. pixel events such
    as purchases or page visits). Processed data include hashed contact details, pixel event data, IP address,
    device type, browser information, and timestamps.
