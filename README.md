🥖 Nourish — Project Overview & Rationale

Nourish is an elegant and fully responsive e-commerce web application designed for a modern, health-conscious bakery brand. The project aims to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience for artisanal baked goods, catering to individuals who value convenience, quality, and transparency in what they consume.

The website offers a clean and intuitive interface where users can browse through products, view detailed descriptions, add items to their shopping bag, and complete secure checkouts. Beyond shopping, Nourish integrates features such as newsletter subscriptions, FAQs, and a contact page to help build customer trust and engagement — reflecting the kind of holistic customer experience real businesses need.

🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of Nourish is to demonstrate the design and development of a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly online store using Django and Bootstrap, with secure authentication, Stripe payment integration, and backend management for products and orders.
It also seeks to model how small local businesses can expand their reach through digital transformation — taking a neighborhood bakery and giving it a professional online presence.

👥 Target Audience

Nourish is aimed at:

Everyday consumers looking for healthy, fresh, and locally made baked goods.

Small business owners or bakers exploring e-commerce as a way to scale their businesses.

Students and developers interested in learning modern web development, UX design, and full-stack architecture through a real-world concept.

💡 Why This Project (Rationale)

I chose to create Nourish because food, particularly artisan baking, connects people on a personal and emotional level. During recent years, more consumers have shifted toward online purchasing — even for traditionally local products like bread and pastries. This inspired me to build a platform that blends the warmth of a neighborhood bakery with the convenience of modern e-commerce.

It combines backend logic (Django), frontend design (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap), third-party integrations (Stripe, email verification), and real-world business logic — making it creatively fulfilling.

Ultimately, Nourish isn’t just an online bakery — it’s a digital experience built to show how thoughtful design and solid engineering can make even the simplest daily pleasures more accessible and enjoyable.

### Typography

Lato — a modern, highly legible sans-serif font.

Uppercase styling used for headings and branding elements for a professional finish.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### Imagery

High-quality product images showcasing artisanal baked goods.

Uniform aspect ratios to maintain balance and consistency across product cards.

Visuals emphasize freshness, warmth, and craftsmanship — reflecting the brand ethos.

## Wireframes

I created wireframes for the Nourish website to plan the layout, content structure, and user journey across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop). These wireframes helped shape the responsive design and UI decisions made during development.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

### Data Model

The data model for Nourish was designed to support a smooth e-commerce workflow — from product browsing and user management to order processing and customer communication.
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) below illustrates how core components such as users, profiles, products, orders, and contact forms interact with each other to ensure an efficient and scalable system structure.

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help visualize the project’s database architecture, showing how models relate to one another and simplifying both development and maintenance.

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/mairima/nourish/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/images/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/mairima/nourish/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Ecommerce Business Model

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss the business model for your e-commerce project. An example is provided below that aligns closely with **Boutique Ado's B2C** strategy. Be sure to align to your own project requirements.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a **Business to Customer** model. It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers, especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users. For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## SEO & Marketing

### Keywords

To improve **search engine visibility** and help potential customers discover the **Nourish** website, I identified relevant keywords aligned with my brand, products, and audience. These keywords include both **short-tail** and **long-tail** phrases to target general and specific search intents.

I used tools such as [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) to check search frequency and keyword strength (during the free trial period), and also reviewed related trends from Google Search Console and manual competitor analysis.

* * * * *

### **Short-Tail Keywords (Head Terms)**

These help capture high-volume searches for general products and categories:

-   nourish cakes

-   healthy snacks

-   African desserts

-   homemade pastries

-   fresh fruit drinks

-   bakery Berlin

-   online cake shop

-   natural yogurt drink

* * * * *

### **Long-Tail Keywords**

These phrases target more specific and conversion-ready searches:

-   buy pistachio cake online in Berlin

-   best homemade groundnut sweets

-   crunchy chocolate cake near me

-   affordable African snacks delivery

-   order fish pie with home delivery

-   refreshing orange and yogurt drinks

-   handmade cakes and pastries in Germany

-   Nourish bakery healthy dessert shop

* * * * *

### **Example Product Keyword Mapping**

| Product | Category | Example Keywords |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pistachio Cake** | Cakes | pistachio cake Berlin, buy nut cake online, premium handmade cakes |
| **Crunchy Chocolate Cake** | Cakes | chocolate cake Germany, crunchy chocolate dessert, artisan cake shop |
| **Groundnut Sweets** | Snacks | groundnut candy Cameroon style, African sweet snacks, peanut brittle Berlin |
| **Fish Pie** | Snacks | African fish pie recipe, homemade pastry Berlin, savory snack delivery |
| **Yogurt Drink** | Drinks | natural yogurt drink, probiotic drink Berlin, healthy milk beverage |
| **Fresh Orange Drink** | Drinks | freshly squeezed orange juice, vitamin C drink, healthy fruit beverage |

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file. This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://nourish1-cc6378c356ae.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml), which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level. Inside, I've included the default settings:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://nourish1-cc6378c356ae.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

### **Explanation**

-   `User-agent: *` → Applies to all search engine crawlers (Google, Bing, etc.).

-   `Disallow:` → Blank, meaning no pages are blocked from indexing.

-   `Allow: /` → Confirms the entire site is open to crawling.

-   `Sitemap:` → Points to your automatically generated sitemap for structured indexing.

- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales. Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a Facebook business account using Facebook. 

![screenshot](documentation/images/facebookpage-nourish.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their email address if they are interested in learning more. 

**Custom Django Model Newsletter**

📬 Newsletter Feature Implementation -- Nourish Website
------------------------------------------------------

To fulfill the project requirement of including a **newsletter system** and implementing **at least three custom models**, a dedicated app called `newsletter` was created within the Django project.

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1\. **Creating the Newsletter App**

A custom Django app named `newsletter` was generated using:

`python manage.py startapp newsletter`

This separates newsletter-related functionality from other parts of the site and keeps the project modular.

#### 2\. **Defining the Custom Model**

Inside the `models.py` of the `newsletter` app, a `Newsletter` model was created with a single field --- `email`. This is the only field required for users to subscribe.

`# newsletter/models.py

from django.db import models

class Newsletter(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, null=False, blank=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email`

-   The `email` field is **unique**, ensuring that the same email address cannot subscribe more than once.

-   The `__str__` method allows for a readable display of emails in the admin panel.

This model counts as **one of the three required custom models** for the full-stack milestone project.

#### 3\. **Admin Configuration**

To manage subscriptions via the Django admin:

`# newsletter/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Newsletter

admin.site.register(Newsletter)`

This allows site admins to view, add, or delete newsletter entries from the backend.

#### 4\. **Newsletter Form & Frontend Integration**

A basic form was created using Django's `ModelForm`, allowing users to subscribe by submitting their email from a public-facing newsletter page.

The form was added to a `newsletter.html` template linked in the navigation bar, clearly visible to users.

#### 5\. **Sending Emails (Optional Enhancement)**

The `send_mail()` function --- similar to the one used in `webhook_handler.py` for Stripe confirmations --- can be used to notify all newsletter subscribers whenever a **new product** is added.

This would look something like:

`from django.core.mail import send_mail
from .models import Newsletter

def notify_subscribers(product):
    subscribers = Newsletter.objects.all()
    for subscriber in subscribers:
        send_mail(
            subject=f"New Product: {product.name}",
            message=f"Check out our newest product: {product.name} at {product.get_absolute_url()}",
            from_email="noreply@nourish.com",
            recipient_list=[subscriber.email],
            fail_silently=False,
        )`

> This approach enhances user engagement and builds a customer base over time.



## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://nourish1-cc6378c356ae.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment


To deploy my **Nourish** Django website, I used [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com), a **cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that simplifies deployment and hosting of web applications. It allows me to run the app entirely in the cloud without managing servers manually.

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

After creating my Heroku account, here's how I deployed the project:

* * * * *

### 1\. **Create a New Heroku App**

-   I logged into the Heroku Dashboard, clicked **New** (top right), and selected **Create new app**.

-   I gave the app a **unique name** (`nourish1` in my case), chose **Europe (EU)** as the region (since I'm based in Germany), and clicked **Create App**.

* * * * *

### 2\. **Set Environment Variables**

-   In the app dashboard, I navigated to **Settings > Reveal Config Vars**.

-   I manually added the same environment variables from my local `env.py` file, such as:

    -   `SECRET_KEY`

    -   `DEBUG = False`

    -   `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

    -   `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.

    -   `DATABASE_URL` (automatically added by Heroku Postgres)

* * * * *

### 3\. **Prepare for Deployment**

-   I pushed my code to GitHub, ensuring the `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt` were included in the repo.

-   In the **Deploy** tab of the Heroku dashboard, I:

    -   Linked the Heroku app to my GitHub repo.

    -   Enabled **Automatic Deploys** (so each push to main redeploys the app).

    -   Clicked **Deploy Branch** for the first-time manual deploy.

* * * * *

### 4\. **Final Touches**

-   After deployment, I ran the following from the **Heroku CLI** (or manually via the dashboard):

    `heroku run python manage.py migrate
    heroku run python manage.py collectstatic`

-   I also set up **Heroku Postgres** (as the production database) and **Cloudinary** for static/media files.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`     | your-cloudinary-cloud-name                 |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`        | your-cloudinary-api-key                    |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`     | your-cloudinary-api-secret                |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user-inserts-own-gmail-api-key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)
- [.python-version](.python-version)

Requirements & Deployment Configuration (Steps I Took)

To prepare my Nourish project for deployment on Heroku, I followed these steps:

1. ✅ Installed Project Requirements

I used the provided requirements.txt file to install all necessary dependencies locally:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


If I installed new packages during development, I updated the file using:

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt


This ensured Heroku had all the packages needed for a successful build.

2. ✅ Created the Procfile

To tell Heroku how to run the app, I created a Procfile at the root of mRequirements & Deployment Configuration (Steps I Took)
-------------------------------------------------------

To prepare my Nourish project for deployment on **Heroku**, I followed these steps:

* * * * *

### 1\. ✅ Installed Project Requirements

I used the provided `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary dependencies locally:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If I installed new packages during development, I updated the file using:

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

This ensured Heroku had all the packages needed for a successful build.

* * * * *

### 2\. ✅ Created the Procfile

To tell Heroku how to run the app, I created a `Procfile` at the root of my project:

`echo web: gunicorn nourish.wsgi > Procfile`

> In my case, the main Django app is called `nourish`, so I used `nourish.wsgi`.

* * * * *

### 3\. ✅ Specified the Python Version

To ensure Heroku used the correct Python version, I created a file called `.python-version` with the following:

`3.12`

This matches the Python version I used locally and helps avoid compatibility issues.

* * * * *

### 4\. 🚀 Deployed to Heroku

After pushing my code to GitHub, I went to my Heroku app dashboard and:

-   Connected my Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

-   Enabled **Automatic Deployment** from the `main` branch, so every push redeploys the site.

-   Clicked **Deploy Branch** once for the initial deploy.

After deployment, I ran:

`heroku run python manage.py migrate
heroku run python manage.py collectstatic`

This completed the database setup and prepared static files for production.y project:

echo web: gunicorn nourish.wsgi > Procfile


In my case, the main Django app is called nourish, so I used nourish.wsgi.

3. ✅ Specified the Python Version

To ensure Heroku used the correct Python version, I created a file called .python-version with the following:

3.12


This matches the Python version I used locally and helps avoid compatibility issues.

4. 🚀 Deployed to Heroku

After pushing my code to GitHub, I went to my Heroku app dashboard and:

Connected my Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

Enabled Automatic Deployment from the main branch, so every push redeploys the site.

Clicked Deploy Branch once for the initial deploy.

After deployment, I ran:

heroku run python manage.py migrate
heroku run python manage.py collectstatic


This completed the database setup and prepared static files for production.

The project could now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

🖼️ Using Cloudinary to Store Media Files
-----------------------------------------

Since Heroku doesn't persist static or media files (e.g., product images), I integrated [**Cloudinary**](https://cloudinary.com) into my Nourish Django project to handle all **media asset storage and delivery**.

###  How to Set It Up

1.  **I created a free Cloudinary account** and logged into the dashboard.

    -   For "Primary Interest", I selected **Programmable Media for image and video API**.

2.  In my dashboard, I copied my **Cloudinary API Environment Variable**.

    -   It looks like:

        `CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@your-cloud-name`

    -   I removed the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` and used the rest as the **value** for the key `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

3.  I added this to my local `env.py` like this:

    `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@your-cloud-name"`

4.  I also added the same key and value to **Heroku Config Vars** in the dashboard:

    -   **Key**: `CLOUDINARY_URL`

    -   **Value**: `cloudinary://...@your-cloud-name`

5.  Finally, I updated the Django settings and installed the necessary packages:

    `pip install cloudinary django-cloudinary-storage`

    In `settings.py`, I added:

    `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'`

### PostgreSQL

Database – PostgreSQL (Code Institute)

For the Nourish website, I used the Code Institute PostgreSQL Database
 as the relational database, connected through Django.
This database was ideal for development and deployment since it integrates smoothly with Heroku.

How I Set It Up

I visited the CI PostgreSQL Database page
 and submitted my email address.

I received an email with my database credentials and a connection URL similar to this:

postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host>/<db_name>


I then copied this full database URL into:

My local env.py file, and

My Heroku Config Vars under the key DATABASE_URL.

This connected my Django application to the hosted PostgreSQL database, allowing all my data — such as users, orders, products, and newsletter subscriptions — to be stored safely online.

Note: Code Institute databases are only for CI students and have a limited lifespan (max 8 per student, up to 18 months).
For future production, I plan to migrate to a personal PostgreSQL instance (e.g., via Render or ElephantSQL).

### Stripe API (Payments Integration)

For processing secure online payments, I integrated Stripe
 into the Nourish website.
Stripe handles all transactions during checkout, ensuring encrypted and verified payment processing.

Steps I Took

I created a Stripe account, logged into the dashboard, and retrieved the test API keys:

STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY → starts with pk_

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY → starts with sk_

I added both keys to:

My local env.py file

My Heroku Config Vars

I set up Stripe Webhooks to handle order confirmation events (in case users close the payment window early):

From the Stripe dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add Endpoint

Added:

https://nourish1-cc6378c356ae.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/


Selected “Receive all events”

Copied the Signing Secret as:

STRIPE_WH_SECRET


All these keys are stored securely as environment variables. Stripe now automatically handles checkout, payment confirmation, and order success for customers.

### Gmail API (Email Notifications)

To send confirmation emails to customers after successful purchases, I integrated Gmail’s SMTP service
.

How I Configured It

I enabled 2-Step Verification for my Gmail account.

Under Google Account → Security → App Passwords, I generated a 16-character app password.

I used these two environment variables in my project:

EMAIL_HOST_USER = myemail@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASS = <16-character-app-password>


These were added to both env.py and Heroku Config Vars.

This setup allowed the site to automatically send:

Order confirmation emails

Stripe payment receipts

Future newsletter subscription confirmations

### WhiteNoise Static File Handling

Since Heroku doesn’t persist static files, I used WhiteNoise
 to serve static assets (CSS, JS) efficiently during deployment.

✅ Steps I Followed

Installed WhiteNoise:

pip install whitenoise


Updated the requirements.txt file:

pip freeze --local > requirements.txt


Added WhiteNoise middleware in settings.py:

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # Other middleware below
]


Ran:

python manage.py collectstatic


WhiteNoise ensures my static files (Bootstrap, CSS, JS) load instantly on Heroku even without external storage.

### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.


I created a file called env.py in the project root to store my environment variables (same as Heroku Config Vars).

Note:
The values in env.py (Stripe keys, Cloudinary URL, Database URL, etc.) are unique to my project and must be replaced with your own if you clone this repository.

✅ Summary of Environment Variables Used

Variable	Description
SECRET_KEY	Django secret key
DATABASE_URL	PostgreSQL connection URL
CLOUDINARY_URL	Cloudinary media storage
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY	Stripe publishable key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY	Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WH_SECRET	Stripe webhook signing secret
EMAIL_HOST_USER	Gmail address
EMAIL_HOST_PASS	Gmail app password


Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "cloudinary://<your_api_key>:<your_api_secret>@<your_cloud_name>")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (not to include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

## Credits

### Project Idea & Design

-   The overall concept for the **Nourish** website --- an online store for cakes, snacks, and drinks --- was **inspired by real-world artisanal bakeries** and food brands, as well as personal interest in African and homemade baked goods.
